"The Wandering Officer" was an event held at Kinfolx in Oakland, CA on January
22, 2026, to introduce newly public databases for police accountability,
connect them to California's new law creating the possibility to decertify
police who commit serious misconduct, and provide resources and support for
community members who experience bad encounters with police.

The event was co-hosted by:

- [Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP)](https://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/)
- [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)
- [Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)](https://hrdag.org/)
- [Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network
  (CLEAN)](https://clean.calmatters.org/)
- [National Police Index (NPI)](https://national.cpdp.co/)

# Databases

### [Police Records Access Project](https://clean.calmatters.org/)

A searchable database of police records made public under California's "Right
to Know" laws (SB-1421 and SB-16). Includes internal investigative and other
records related to internal investigations of serious misconduct and uses of
force

### [National Police Index](https://national.cpdp.co/)

A nation-wide database (including California) of police employment records. Can
be used to track police officers who move across departments.

# Filing complaints against the police

In Oakland, there are multiple agencies with whom you can file a complaint
about the police:

### Oakland Police Department (OPD) Internal Affairs Division

There is a 24-hour Complaint Hotline: (866) 214-8834 where you can file a
complaint by leaving a detailed message. For information on how to file a
complaint in person or by mail, see
[here](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety-Streets/Report-Police-Misconduct)

### Community Police Review Agency (CPRA)

The Community Police Review Agency (CPRA) is a civilian-run, community-centered
police oversight agency that investigates allegations of Oakland Police
Department (OPD) misconduct.

You can submit a complaint about an OPD officer to CPRA [using this
form](https://apps.oaklandca.gov/cprapublic/Home.aspx). Find more information
about filing complaints through CPRA [at the CPRA
website](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Government/Departments/Community-Police-Review-Agency)

### Submit a complaint through POST

The Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission is a state-wide
agency that oversees law enforcement training and standards in California. As
of 2022, they accept complaints from the public about police officers for
possible decertification.

POST will only investigate complaints regarding "serious" misconduct as defined
under SB-2. For the purposes of filing a complaint with POST, "serious"
misconduct is one of: Abuse of Power, Physical abuse, Sexual assault,
Demonstrating bias, Acts that violate the law, Participation in a law
enforcement gang, Failure to cooperate. See [here](https://www.aclunorcal.org/campaigns-initiatives/police-decertification-california-how-it-works/#seriousmisconduct) for more details on what complaints POST will investigate.

You can submit complaints to POST through [this online
form](https://post.ca.gov/public-complaint-form), or by downloading and
completing [this PDF](https://post.ca.gov/Portals/0/post_docs/forms/2-354.pdf).

See [the ACLU
guide](https://www.aclunorcal.org/campaigns-initiatives/police-decertification-california-how-it-works/#complaint)
for information on filing a complaint with POST. In particular, note their
advice:

>You should first create a paper trail by filing a complaint to the local law
>enforcement or oversight agency where the offending officer is employed. You
>can also submit your complaint to POST so that there is a record of them
>receiving it. However, in most cases, POST will refer the complaint back to
>the local agency to conduct their initial investigation. Once the initial
>investigation is complete, POST will review the findings to see if the
>officer’s conduct warrants decertification.


# Additional resources about POST Decertification

The Kenneth Ross, Jr. Police Decertification Act of 2021 (SB 2) established a
statewide system to decertify or suspend officers who have committed serious
misconduct.

# Research

### [The Wandering Officer](https://yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer)

>"Wandering officers" are law-enforcement officers fired by one
>department, sometimes for serious misconduct, who then find work at another
>agency. Policing experts hold disparate views about the extent and character
>of the wandering-officer phenomenon. Some insist that wandering officers are
>everywhere—possibly increasingly so—and that they’re dangerous. Others,
>however, maintain that critics cherry-pick rare and egregious anecdotes that
>distort broader realities. In the absence of systematic data, we simply do not
>know how common wandering officers are or how much of a threat they pose, nor
>can we know whether and how to address the issue through policy reform.
>
>In this Article, we conduct the first systematic investigation of wandering
>officers and possibly the largest quantitative study of police misconduct of
>any kind. We introduce a novel data set of all 98,000 full-time
>law-enforcement officers employed by almost 500 different agencies in the
>State of Florida over a thirty-year period. We report three principal
>findings. First, in any given year during our study, an average of just under
>1,100 officers who were previously fired—three percent of all officers in the
>State—worked for Florida agencies. Second, officers who were fired from their
>last job seem to face difficulty finding work. When they do, it takes them a
>long time, and they tend to move to smaller agencies with fewer resources in
>areas with slightly larger communities of color. Interestingly, though, this
>pattern does not hold for officers who were fired earlier in their careers.
>Third, wandering officers are more likely than both officers hired as rookies
>and those hired as veterans who have never been fired to be fired from their
>next job or to receive a complaint for a “moral character violation.” Although
>we cannot determine the precise reasons for the firings, these results suggest
>that wandering officers may pose serious risks, particularly given how
>difficult it is to fire a police officer. We consider several plausible
>explanations for why departments nonetheless hire wandering officers and
>suggest potential policy responses to each.

### [Identifying misconduct-committing officer crews in the Chicago police department](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267217)

>Explanations for police misconduct often center on a narrow notion of "problem
>officers," the proverbial "bad apples." Such an individualistic approach not
>only ignores the larger systemic problems of policing but also takes for
>granted the group-based nature of police work. Nearly all of police work is
>group-based and officers' formal and informal networks can impact behavior,
>including misconduct. In extreme cases, groups of officers (what we refer to
>as, "crews") have even been observed to coordinate their abusive and even
>criminal behaviors. This study adopts a social network and machine learning
>approach to empirically investigate the presence and impact of officer crews
>engaging in alleged misconduct in a major U.S. city: Chicago, IL. Using data
>on Chicago police officers between 1971 and 2018, we identify potential crews
>and analyze their impact on alleged misconduct and violence. Results detected
>approximately 160 possible crews, comprised of less than 4% of all Chicago
>police officers. Officers in these crews were involved in an outsized amount
>of alleged and actual misconduct, accounting for approximately 25% of all use
>of force complaints, city payouts for civil and criminal litigations, and
>police-involved shootings. The detected crews also contributed to racial
>disparities in arrests and civilian complaints, generating nearly 18% of all
>complaints filed by Black Chicagoans and 14% of complaints filed by Hispanic
>Chicagoans.

### [Private Security and Public Police](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4737135)

>Private security officers outnumber police by a wide margin, and the gap may
>be growing. As cities have claimed to defund the police, many have quietly
>expanded their use of private security, reallocating spending from the public
>to the private sector. It is difficult to know what to make of these trends,
>largely because we know so little about what private security looks like on
>the ground. On one prevalent view of the facts, a shift from public to private
>security would mean little more than a change of uniform, as the two labor
>markets are deeply intertwined. Indeed, academics, the media, popular culture,
>and the police themselves all tell us that private security is some amalgam of
>a police retirement community and a dumping ground for disgraced former cops.
>But if, instead, private officers differ systematically from the public
>police—and crossover between the sectors is limited—then substitution from
>policing to private security could drastically change who is providing
>security services.

>We bring novel data to bear on these questions, presenting the largest
>empirical study of private security to date. We introduce an administrative
>dataset covering nearly 300,000 licensed private security officers in the
>State of Florida. By linking this dataset to similarly comprehensive
>information about public law enforcement, we have, for the first time, a
>nearly complete picture of the entire security labor market in one state. We
>report two principal findings. First, the public and private security markets
>are predominantly characterized by occupational segregation, not integration.
>The individuals who compose the private security sector differ markedly from
>the public police; they are, for example, significantly less likely to be
>white men. We also find that few private officers, roughly 2%, have previously
>worked in public policing, and even fewer will go on to policing in the
>future. Second, while former police make up a small share of all private
>security, roughly a quarter of cops who do cross over have been fired from a
>policing job. In fact, fired police officers are nearly as likely to land in
>private security as to find another policing job, and a full quarter end up in
>one or the other. We explore the implications of these findings, including
>intersections with police abolition and the future of policing, at the paper’s
>close.

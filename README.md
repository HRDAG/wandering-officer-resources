"The Wandering Officer" was an event held at Kinfolx in Oakland, CA on January
22, 2026, to introduce newly public databases for police accountability,
connect them to California's new law creating the possibility to decertify
police who commit serious misconduct, and provide resources and support for
community members who experience bad encounters with police.

The event was co-hosted by:

- [Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP)](https://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/)
- [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)
- [Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)](https://hrdag.org/)
- [Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network
  (CLEAN)](https://clean.calmatters.org/)
- [National Police Index (NPI)](https://national.cpdp.co/)

records related to internal investigations of serious misconduct and uses of
force

# Filing complaints against the police

In Oakland, there are multiple agencies with whom you can file a complaint
about the police:

## [Oakland Police Department (OPD) Internal Affairs Division](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety-Streets/Report-Police-Misconduct)

There is a 24-hour Complaint Hotline: (866) 214-8834 where you can file a
complaint by leaving a detailed message. For information on how to file a
complaint in person or by mail, see
[here](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Public-Safety-Streets/Report-Police-Misconduct)

## [Community Police Review Agency (CPRA)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Government/Departments/Community-Police-Review-Agency)

The Community Police Review Agency (CPRA) is a civilian-run, community-centered
police oversight agency that investigates allegations of Oakland Police
Department (OPD) misconduct.

You can submit a complaint about an OPD officer to CPRA [using the CPRA online
form](https://apps.oaklandca.gov/cprapublic/Home.aspx). Find more information
about filing complaints through CPRA [at the CPRA
website](https://www.oaklandca.gov/Government/Departments/Community-Police-Review-Agency)

## [Submit a complaint through POST](https://post.ca.gov/public-complaints)

The Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission is a state-wide
agency that oversees law enforcement training and standards in California. As
of 2022, they accept complaints from the public about police officers for
possible decertification.

POST will only investigate complaints regarding "serious" misconduct as defined
under SB-2. This includes any of the following

- Abuse of Power
- Physical abuse
- Sexual assault
- Demonstrating bias
- Acts that violate the law
- Participation in a law enforcement gang
- Failure to cooperate

See [this reference](https://www.aclunorcal.org/campaigns-initiatives/police-decertification-california-how-it-works/#seriousmisconduct)
for definitions and examples of each type of serious misconduct.

You can submit complaints to POST through [this online
form](https://post.ca.gov/public-complaint-form), or by downloading and
completing [this PDF](https://post.ca.gov/Portals/0/post_docs/forms/2-354.pdf).

[The ACLU
guide](https://www.aclunorcal.org/campaigns-initiatives/police-decertification-california-how-it-works/#complaint)
provides detailed information on filing a complaint with POST. In particular,
they advise:

>You should first create a paper trail by filing a complaint to the local law
>enforcement or oversight agency where the offending officer is employed. You
>can also submit your complaint to POST so that there is a record of them
>receiving it. However, in most cases, POST will refer the complaint back to
>the local agency to conduct their initial investigation. Once the initial
>investigation is complete, POST will review the findings to see if the
>officer’s conduct warrants decertification.

# Making public records requests under the Public Records Act (PRA)

## [Police Transparency Handbook](https://firstamendmentcoalition.org/handbook/police-transparency-handbook/)

This comprehensive guide from the First Amendment Coalition is specifically
about making records requests for police use-of-force and officer misconduct
records made public under California's SB-1421 and SB-16 ("Right to Know")
laws.

## [FOIA Basics for Activists](https://www.foiabasics.org/)

This resource is designed to support activists, organizers, and social
movements in filing FOIA requests to aid their ongoing campaigns and work. The
resource covers all types of public records requests, including state-level and
federal requests.

# Additional resources about POST Decertification

The Kenneth Ross, Jr. Police Decertification Act of 2021 (SB 2) established a
statewide system to decertify or suspend officers who have committed serious
misconduct.

# Research

### [The Wandering Officer](https://yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer)

>"Wandering officers" are law-enforcement officers fired by one
>department, sometimes for serious misconduct, who then find work at another
>agency . . .. We introduce a novel data set of all 98,000 full-time
>law-enforcement officers employed by almost 500 different agencies in the
>State of Florida over a thirty-year period. We report three principal
>findings. First, in any given year during our study, an average of just under
>1,100 officers who were previously fired—three percent of all officers in the
>State—worked for Florida agencies. Second, officers who were fired from their
>last job seem to face difficulty finding work. When they do, it takes them a
>long time, and they tend to move to smaller agencies with fewer resources in
>areas with slightly larger communities of color. Interestingly, though, this
>pattern does not hold for officers who were fired earlier in their careers.
>Third, wandering officers are more likely than both officers hired as rookies
>and those hired as veterans who have never been fired to be fired from their
>next job or to receive a complaint for a "moral character violation."

### [Identifying misconduct-committing officer crews in the Chicago police department](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267217)

>This study adopts a social network and machine learning approach to
>empirically investigate the presence and impact of officer crews engaging in
>alleged misconduct in a major U.S. city: Chicago, IL. Using data on Chicago
>police officers between 1971 and 2018, we identify potential crews and analyze
>their impact on alleged misconduct and violence. Results detected
>approximately 160 possible crews, comprised of less than 4% of all Chicago
>police officers. Officers in these crews were involved in an outsized amount
>of alleged and actual misconduct, accounting for approximately 25% of all use
>of force complaints, city payouts for civil and criminal litigations, and
>police-involved shootings. The detected crews also contributed to racial
>disparities in arrests and civilian complaints, generating nearly 18% of all
>complaints filed by Black Chicagoans and 14% of complaints filed by Hispanic
>Chicagoans.

### [Private Security and Public Police](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4737135)

>We introduce an administrative dataset covering nearly 300,000 licensed
>private security officers in the State of Florida. By linking this dataset to
>similarly comprehensive information about public law enforcement, we have, for
>the first time, a nearly complete picture of the entire security labor market
>in one state. We report two principal findings . . . while former police make
>up a small share of all private security, roughly a quarter of cops who do
>cross over have been fired from a policing job. In fact, fired police officers
>are nearly as likely to land in private security as to find another policing
>job, and a full quarter end up in one or the other.
